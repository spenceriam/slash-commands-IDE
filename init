Please analyze this codebase and create a INIT.md file containing:
1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.

- The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 20 lines long.\
- If there's already a CLAUDE.md, improve it.\
- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them.\
- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:
